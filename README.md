# CrochetRoulette
An application that takes 3 inputs (yarn type, crochet hook size, and size of project) and uses Google Custom Search Engine as an API to find and deliver a crochet project that matches the 3 parameters.  Users can bypass the 3 inputs by choosing "Random" and will be presented with a random crochet project search result.
